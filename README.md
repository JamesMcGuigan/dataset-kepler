# Exploratory Data Analysis - Kepler Object of Interest Dataset

The Kepler Space telescope was designed to survey a small section of the sky (105 deg^2 = 1/400th of sky),
using the transit method to discover Earth-size exoplanets in or near habitable zone 
and estimate how many stars in the Milky Way have such planets.

During its over nine and a half years of service, Kepler observed 530,506 stars and detected 2,662 planets.
